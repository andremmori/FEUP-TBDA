The project can be found [here](project1/).

### Project 2 - Object Relational

> Think about the possibilities open by the object-relational schema, with respect to the relational schema, namely the use of user defined types, with objects combining data structures and the functions to manipulate them, inheritance, nested tables and vectors, object references and comparison and sorting methods. Develop a small illustrative database

The project can be found [here](project2/).
